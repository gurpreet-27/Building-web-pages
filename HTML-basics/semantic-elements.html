    <h1>My Favourite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
    <h2>DC heroes</h2>
    <p><em> superhero comics are the best.</em> <br>
        The storylines are more complex, and <u>often address real life social issues.</u> My favourate is <strong> Green Arrow </strong></p>
    <h3><small>Marvel heroes or whatever</small></h3>
    <p><q> superhero comics feel more 2-dimensional.</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the films and TV industry. Whereas, DC attempts to capitalize on the TV and film industries are more mediocre.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>  But they do have decent movies and TV shows for whatever that's worth.</p>
    <blockquote>summarize, Marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote>
